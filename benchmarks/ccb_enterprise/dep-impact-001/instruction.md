# Impact Analysis: ModelAdmin.get_list_filter()

**Repository:** django/django
**Access Scope:** You may read any file. Write your results to `/workspace/submission.json`.

## Context

Django's admin framework allows customization via `ModelAdmin` subclasses. The method `get_list_filter()` controls which filters appear in the admin list view. It is defined on the `ModelAdmin` class and can be overridden by subclasses.

A developer is planning to change the signature of `get_list_filter()` to accept an additional parameter. Before making this change, they need a complete impact analysis: which files in the Django codebase would be affected?

## Task

Identify all files in the Django repository that define, override, call, or reference `get_list_filter`. Write your findings as a JSON array of file paths to `/workspace/submission.json`.

**YOU MUST CREATE A submission.json FILE.**

### Requirements

1. **Find the definition** — Locate where `get_list_filter` is defined in the Django admin codebase
2. **Find all overrides** — Search for classes that override `get_list_filter` (subclasses of `ModelAdmin` that define their own version)
3. **Find all callers** — Search for code that calls `get_list_filter()` or `.get_list_filter(`
4. **Find documentation references** — Search docs/ for mentions of `get_list_filter`
5. **Find test references** — Search tests/ for `get_list_filter` usage
6. **Write submission** — Create `/workspace/submission.json` containing a JSON array of all affected file paths, relative to the repository root

### Output Format

Create `/workspace/submission.json` with a JSON array of file paths:
```json
[
  "path/to/affected/file.py",
  "path/to/another/file.py"
]
```

## Success Criteria

- `/workspace/submission.json` exists and is valid JSON
- The file contains a JSON array of file path strings
- High precision: all listed files actually reference `get_list_filter`
- High recall: no files that reference `get_list_filter` are missed
- Scoring uses F1 measure (harmonic mean of precision and recall)
