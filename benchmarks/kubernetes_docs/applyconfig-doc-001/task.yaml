description: |
  Generate comprehensive package documentation (doc.go) for the client-go
  applyconfigurations package. This package provides type-safe representations
  for Server-side Apply requests.

task_prompt: |
  You are documenting the `staging/src/k8s.io/client-go/applyconfigurations`
  package in Kubernetes. The existing documentation has been removed.

  Your task is to create a `doc.go` file that:
  1. Explains type-safe apply configurations for Server-side Apply
  2. Shows why standard Go structs are incompatible with apply
  3. Documents With<FieldName> builder functions
  4. Covers controller support (recreate vs extract/modify/apply)
  5. Includes code examples

expected_output:
  type: file
  filename: doc.go
  location: staging/src/k8s.io/client-go/applyconfigurations/doc.go

ground_truth:
  primary_file: ground_truth/doc.go

verifier:
  type: script
  script: test.sh

mcp_expected_value: high
mcp_rationale: |
  With Sourcegraph tools, an agent can:
  - Discover how typed clients use Apply methods with apply configurations
  - Find cross-references to metav1.ApplyOptions and FieldManager
  - Understand the generated With<FieldName> patterns across API groups
  - See how controllers use the extract/modify/apply workflow
