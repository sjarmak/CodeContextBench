description: |
  Generate comprehensive package documentation (doc.go) for the apiserver
  library. This library provides the machinery for building Kubernetes-style
  API servers, including extension API servers via API aggregation.

task_prompt: |
  You are documenting the `staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver` package in Kubernetes.
  The existing documentation has been removed.

  Your task is to create a `doc.go` file that:
  1. Explains apiserver as the framework for building API servers
  2. Documents key sub-packages (server, admission, authentication, authorization, endpoints, registry)
  3. Describes GenericAPIServer
  4. Covers extension API servers and API aggregation
  5. Notes preferred alternatives (CRDs, webhooks)

expected_output:
  type: file
  filename: doc.go
  location: staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/doc.go

ground_truth:
  primary_file: ground_truth/doc.go

verifier:
  type: script
  script: test.sh

mcp_expected_value: high
mcp_rationale: |
  With Sourcegraph tools, an agent can:
  - Discover how GenericAPIServer composes the sub-packages
  - Find how admission plugins are registered and invoked
  - Understand the API aggregation mechanism
  - See how kube-apiserver uses the library
