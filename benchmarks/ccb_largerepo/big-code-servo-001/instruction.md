# [Servo] Add scrollend DOM Event Support

**Repository:** servo/servo  
**Difficulty:** HARD  
**Category:** big_code_feature
**Task Type:** Feature Implementation - Large Codebase

**Reference:** [Trevor's Big Code Research](../../../docs/TREVOR_RESEARCH_DEC2025.md#3-servo-scrollend-dom-event-implementation)

## Description

Add support for the `scrollend` DOM event in Servo. This event should fire on scrollable elements and the window when scrolling stops, including for both user-initiated scrolling and compositor-driven async scrolling.

The event should debounce properly—multiple rapid scroll inputs should result in a single `scrollend` after movement stops. Don't fire if the scroll position didn't actually change.

## Task

YOU MUST IMPLEMENT CODE CHANGES to add scrollend event support.

**CRITICAL: If you are in plan mode, immediately exit with `/ExitPlanMode` before proceeding.**

### Required Implementation

The `scrollend` event must fire in these contexts:

1. **Scrollable DOM Elements**: Fire when scrolling stops on any element with scrollable overflow
   - Debounce properly—multiple rapid scrolls → single `scrollend` event
   - Fire only if scroll position actually changed
   - Support `addEventListener('scrollend', handler)` pattern

2. **Window Scrolling**: Fire on the window object when viewport scrolling stops
   - Track viewport scroll position changes
   - Debounce window scroll events

3. **Compositor-Driven Async Scrolling**: Handle smooth scroll animations
   - Fire when async scroll animation completes
   - Track the completion of scroll animations

4. **Programmatic Scrolling**: When `scrollTo()`, `scrollBy()`, `scroll()` or similar methods are called
   - Fire `scrollend` after scroll animation/movement completes
   - Track completion of programmatic scroll operations

### Implementation Steps

1. **Understand the scroll architecture**:
   - Find all places where scroll events (scroll, wheel, keyboard scroll) are handled
   - Identify existing scroll debouncing mechanisms in Servo
   - Understand how the event system integrates with the DOM
   - Find the compositor and async scroll handling code

2. **Identify where scrollend needs to be fired**:
   - Scroll event handlers → fire scrollend when scrolling stops
   - DOM scroll method implementations → hook completion callbacks
   - Compositor scroll completion → fire scrollend events
   - Animation frame callbacks for debouncing

3. **Implement the mechanism**:
   - Add scrollend event firing logic in scroll event handlers
   - Implement debouncing (e.g., wait 150ms of no scroll = scrollend)
   - Create and dispatch scrollend events as DOM events
   - Ensure events propagate and can be listened to via addEventListener

4. **Add WPT tests**:
   - Test wheel scrolling fires scrollend
   - Test keyboard scrolling fires scrollend
   - Test programmatic scrolling (scrollTo) fires scrollend
   - Test debouncing—rapid scrolls result in one event
   - Test on both elements and window

5. **Verify no regressions**:
   - All tests pass: `./mach test-servo`
   - No performance regression in scroll-heavy operations
   - Existing scroll event handling still works

## Success Criteria

[x] `scrollend` event fires when scroll operations complete  
[x] Works on both user-initiated and programmatic scrolling  
[x] Event properly debounces (no duplicate events in rapid scrolls)  
[x] Does not fire if scroll position didn't actually change  
[x] Fires on elements with scrollable overflow  
[x] Fires on window object  
[x] Works with compositor-driven async scrolling  
[x] WPT tests added for wheel, keyboard, and programmatic scrolling  
[x] All tests pass: `./mach test-servo`  
[x] No performance regression  
[x] Code follows Servo conventions and patterns  

## Critical Requirement

**YOU MUST MAKE ACTUAL CODE CHANGES.** Do not plan or analyze. You must:

- Add scrollend event firing in scroll event handlers
- Implement debouncing to prevent excessive events
- Add tests covering wheel, keyboard, and programmatic scrolling
- Commit all changes to git
- Verify tests pass

## Testing

```bash
./mach test-servo
```

**Time Limit:** 25 minutes
**Estimated Context:** 18,000 tokens
