# Big Code & Multi-Repo Tasks

This task suite involves large codebases and multi-repository systems.

## Search Strategy for Big Code Problems

**This repository is large.** Effective search strategy is critical:

- Use broad searches to find all references across the codebase
- Understand patterns and conventions at scale
- For cross-module searches, use comprehensive search approaches rather than narrow, single-directory scopes

## Search Strategy for Multi-Repo Problems

**This repository is part of a multi-repository codebase.** For questions about other repositories:

- Trace cross-repo interactions and data flow
- Reference APIs from external services
- Use tools that provide full codebase context across all repos
