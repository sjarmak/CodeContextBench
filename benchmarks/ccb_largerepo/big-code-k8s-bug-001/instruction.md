# big-code-k8s-bug-001: Missing ResourceSlice Event Handler in Kubernetes Scheduler

## Task

Investigate a bug in the Kubernetes scheduler where pods requesting Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) devices become permanently stuck in an Unschedulable state when the DRA driver starts after the pod is created. Trace the execution path through the scheduler's event-driven re-queuing architecture to identify why ResourceSlice creation/update events are silently dropped.

## Context

- **Repository**: kubernetes/kubernetes (Go, ~3.5M LOC)
- **Category**: Bug Investigation
- **Difficulty**: hard
- **Entry Point**: `pkg/scheduler/schedule_one.go` — `ScheduleOne()` method

## Symptom

When a pod requests a DRA device and the DRA driver starts *after* the pod is created, the pod becomes permanently stuck in `Pending` with reason `Unschedulable`. The scheduler logs `"cannot allocate all claims"` because no ResourceSlices exist at scheduling time. After the driver starts and publishes ResourceSlice objects, the pod should be rescheduled — but it never is.

The bug is a race condition: if the driver starts first, scheduling succeeds immediately. But if the pod arrives before the driver, the scheduler never retries because ResourceSlice events are not wired into the scheduling queue's re-evaluation mechanism.

## Requirements

1. Starting from the entry point, trace the execution path to the root cause
2. Identify the specific file(s) and line(s) where the bug originates
3. Explain WHY the bug occurs — focus on the event handler registration mechanism and the scheduling queue's re-evaluation trigger
4. Propose a fix with specific code changes

## Expected Output

Write your analysis to `/logs/agent/solution.md` with the following structure:

```markdown
## Files Examined
- path/to/file1.ext — examined for [reason]
- path/to/file2.ext — examined for [reason]
...

## Dependency Chain
1. Symptom observed in: path/to/symptom.ext
2. Called from: path/to/caller.ext (function name)
3. Bug triggered by: path/to/buggy.ext (function name, line ~N)
...

## Root Cause
- **File**: path/to/root_cause.ext
- **Function**: function_name()
- **Line**: ~N
- **Explanation**: [Why this code is buggy]

## Proposed Fix
```diff
- buggy code
+ fixed code
```

## Analysis
[Detailed trace from symptom to root cause, explaining each step]
```

## Evaluation Criteria

- Root cause identification: Did you find the correct file(s) where the bug originates?
- Call chain accuracy: Did you trace the correct path from symptom to root cause?
- Fix quality: Is the proposed fix correct and minimal?
