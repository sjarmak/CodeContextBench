  "nl_description": "\n1. **Purpose**: The function rearranges the elements of a multi-dimensional array based on specified new axis orders, effectively reorienting the data structure.\n2. **Input**: The function takes three parameters: a multi-dimensional array, its current dimensions, and the new order of axes.\n3. **Output**: It returns a tuple containing the newly arranged array and its new shape.\n4. **Procedure**: The function first calculates the new shape and stride for the array based on the new axis order. It then computes an inverse mapping of the stride to facilitate re-indexing. Using this mapping, it iterates over the original array, calculates the new index for each element in the rearranged array, and assigns the values accordingly.\n",
