  "nl_description": "\n1. **Purpose**: The purpose of this function is to initialize and manage a specific path within a web application, handling different HTTP methods associated with that path and matching incoming requests to the path.\n2. **Input**: The primary input is a string representing the path which the function will handle.\n3. **Output**: There is no direct output from the constructor function itself, but it sets up an environment to manage HTTP requests for the specified path, including storing handlers and parameters.\n4. **Procedure**: The procedure involves initializing the path and an empty list for middleware handlers. It sets up debugging for the path and prepares to handle various HTTP methods. When a request is received, it matches the request's path against the initialized path, extracts parameters, and processes the request using appropriate handlers.\n",
