description: |
  Generate comprehensive package documentation (doc.go) for the client-go
  library. client-go is the official Go client for the Kubernetes API,
  providing typed and dynamic clients, informers, and tools for building
  controllers.

  Evaluation is performed by comparing the generated doc.go against the
  original ground truth using an LLM judge.

task_prompt: |
  You are documenting the `staging/src/k8s.io/client-go` package in Kubernetes.
  The existing documentation has been removed, and you need to recreate it
  based on the source code.

  Your task is to create a `doc.go` file in `staging/src/k8s.io/client-go/` that:
  1. Explains what client-go provides
  2. Documents key sub-packages (kubernetes, dynamic, discovery, rest, tools/cache, tools/clientcmd)
  3. Describes how to connect to the API (in-cluster, kubeconfig)
  4. Covers interacting with API objects (typed, dynamic, CRDs, Server-Side Apply)
  5. Explains the controller pattern

expected_output:
  type: file
  filename: doc.go
  location: staging/src/k8s.io/client-go/doc.go

ground_truth:
  primary_file: ground_truth/doc.go

verifier:
  type: script
  script: test.sh

mcp_expected_value: high
mcp_rationale: |
  With Sourcegraph tools, an agent can:
  - Discover the full set of sub-packages and their interactions
  - Understand how informers, listers, and workqueues compose together
  - Find how client-go is used by controllers throughout the codebase
  - Discover the relationship between typed and dynamic clients
