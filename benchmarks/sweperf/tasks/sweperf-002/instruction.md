# SWE-Perf Performance Optimization Task

## Overview

**Task ID**: sweperf-002
**Repository**: scikit-learn
**Difficulty**: hard
**Target Function**: `sklearn.cluster._k_means._kmeans_single_elkan`
**Baseline Runtime**: 0.182000 seconds

---

## Description

Optimize the K-Means clustering single iteration using Elkan's algorithm for distance computation pruning.

## Target Function

The function to optimize is located at:
- **File**: sklearn/cluster/_k_means_elkan.pyx
- **Function**: `sklearn.cluster._k_means._kmeans_single_elkan`

## Baseline Performance

The current baseline runtime is **0.182000 seconds**.
Your goal is to reduce this runtime while maintaining correctness.


### Optimization Hints

- Use triangle inequality to skip redundant distance calculations
- Maintain upper and lower bounds for cluster assignments
- Consider Cython optimizations for inner loops


## Human Reference

For reference, here is how humans approached this optimization:
Applied triangle inequality optimization (Elkan's algorithm) to skip unnecessary distance calculations, reducing complexity from O(nkd) to O(nkd/b) where b is the pruning factor.

## Instructions

1. Analyze the target function and understand its purpose
2. Profile the code to identify bottlenecks
3. Apply optimizations (algorithmic improvements, vectorization, caching, etc.)
4. Ensure all existing tests pass
5. Benchmark your optimized solution

## Testing

Run the benchmarks with:
```bash
python -m pytest sklearn/cluster/tests/test_k_means.py -v -k elkan
```

## Output

Your optimized code should be in `/workspace/optimized/`.
The verifier will measure runtime improvement as:

```
runtime_reduction = 1 - (optimized_runtime / baseline_runtime)
```

Higher values indicate better optimization. A value of 0.5 means 2x speedup.

## Workspace Structure

```
/workspace/
├── original/          # Original code (read-only reference)
├── optimized/         # Your optimized implementation
├── tests/             # Test suite
└── benchmark_results.json  # Your benchmark output
```

## Output Format

After optimizing the code, write benchmark results to `/workspace/benchmark_results.json`:

```json
{
    "task_id": "sweperf-002",
    "optimized_runtime": 0.05,
    "baseline_runtime": 0.182000,
    "tests_passed": true,
    "tests_total": 10,
    "optimization_notes": "Applied vectorization to inner loop"
}
```

The verifier will use the `optimized_runtime` field to compute your score.

## Tips

- Profile before optimizing to find the real bottlenecks
- Ensure correctness - optimization at the cost of correctness scores 0
- Consider algorithmic complexity first, then micro-optimizations
- Use NumPy/vectorization for numerical code where applicable
- Consider caching for repeated computations
