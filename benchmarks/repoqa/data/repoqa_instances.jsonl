For each combination, it calculates the color value and checks if there is a custom color specified for the current index in the configuration. If a custom color is found, it uses that color; otherwise, it computes the color based on the RGB intensities and updates the color list at the corresponding index.\n", "code_ratio": 0.077502691065662, "repo_topic": "terminal-emulator"}

If so, it flushes the current batch to render its contents. Then, it adds the new item to the batch. If adding this item fills the batch, the function triggers another batch render to process these items and clear the batch for new entries.\n", "code_ratio": 0.16018306636155608, "repo_topic": "terminal-emulator"}
