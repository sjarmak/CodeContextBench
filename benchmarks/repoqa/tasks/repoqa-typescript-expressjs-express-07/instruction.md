# RepoQA: Semantic Retrieval (SR-QA)

## Task: Find the Function

You are searching a large codebase for a specific function based on its behavior.

**Repository**: expressjs/express  
**Language**: typescript  
**Commit**: 815f799310a5627c000d4a5156c1c958e4947b4c

## Function Description

```

1. **Purpose**: The purpose of this function is to initialize and manage a specific path within a web application, handling different HTTP methods associated with that path and matching incoming requests to the path.
2. **Input**: The primary input is a string representing the path which the function will handle.
3. **Output**: There is no direct output from the constructor function itself, but it sets up an environment to manage HTTP requests for the specified path, including storing handlers and parameters.
4. **Procedure**: The procedure involves initializing the path and an empty list for middleware handlers. It sets up debugging for the path and prepares to handle various HTTP methods. When a request is received, it matches the request's path against the initialized path, extracts parameters, and processes the request using appropriate handlers.

```

## Search Strategy

This function **cannot be found by searching for its name** because the name is not provided. You must:

1. **Understand the behavior** described above
2. **Use Sourcegraph MCP semantic search** to find functions matching this behavior
3. **Explore the code** using call graphs and references
4. **Narrow down** candidates until you find the exact function

### Sourcegraph MCP Tools You Should Use

- **`search_codebase`**: Semantic search for functions by behavior
- **`get_definition`**: Look up function definitions
- **`get_references`**: Find where functions are called
- **`get_call_graph`**: Understand function call relationships

## Output Format

You MUST provide your answer as valid JSON and **SAVE IT TO A FILE**:

```json
{
  "function_path": "path/to/file.py",
  "function_name": "the_function_name",
  "justification": "Why this function matches: describe the behavior you found"
}
```

**CRITICAL**: You MUST save the JSON to `/app/solution.json`. This location is required for Harbor verification.

**Your final step MUST be to run this exact bash command:**

```bash
cat > /app/solution.json << 'JSONEOF'
{
  "function_path": "ACTUAL_PATH",
  "function_name": "ACTUAL_NAME", 
  "justification": "ACTUAL_JUSTIFICATION_TEXT"
}
JSONEOF
```

Replace:
- `ACTUAL_PATH`: The file path you found (e.g., "requests/cookies.py" or "src/requests/cookies.py")
- `ACTUAL_NAME`: The function name (e.g., "extract_cookies_to_jar")
- `ACTUAL_JUSTIFICATION_TEXT`: Your explanation of why this is the right function

**You must run this bash command to complete the task.** Harbor will preserve files in `/app/` for the verification step.

## Notes

- The file path should be relative to repository root
- Function names are case-sensitive
- Provide your best match even if uncertain; explain your reasoning
- The justification is scored on how well it explains the function's behavior

## Scoring

- **Perfect** (1.0): Correct path AND name
- **Good** (0.7-0.9): Correct path, similar name OR vice versa
- **Partial** (0.3-0.6): Close approximation
- **Incorrect** (0.0): Wrong function entirely

Use Sourcegraph MCP liberally. That's the point of this task.
