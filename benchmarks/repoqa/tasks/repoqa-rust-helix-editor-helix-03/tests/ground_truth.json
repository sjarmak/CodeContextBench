  "nl_description": "\n1. **Purpose**: The function is designed to determine the language injection details for a specific match within a source code document, including the type of language and whether certain child nodes should be included in the syntax highlighting.\n2. **Input**: The function takes three parameters: a query object, a match result from the query, and a slice of the source code.\n3. **Output**: It returns a tuple containing an optional language marker, an optional node representing the content for injection, and a setting that specifies which child nodes should be included.\n4. **Procedure**: \n   - First, it calls another function to get initial language and content node based on predefined capture indices.\n   - It then iterates over property settings from the query related to the match's pattern index to adjust the language marker and determine how child nodes should be handled based on specific properties like hard-coded language settings or inclusion rules for child nodes.\n",
