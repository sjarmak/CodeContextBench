  "nl_description": "\n1. **Purpose**: To verify that the function correctly parses specific bit segments from a byte array and accurately tracks the remaining unconsumed bytes.\n2. **Input**: An array of bytes intended to be parsed into segments of 4, 8, and 4 bits respectively.\n3. **Output**: A tuple containing the parsed values from the specified bit segments and the array of bytes that were not consumed during the parsing process.\n4. **Procedure**: The function processes the input byte array to extract the first 4 bits, then the next 8 bits, and finally another 4 bits. It checks that the remaining bytes in the array are correctly identified and returned, ensuring that bytes fully consumed by the parsing are not included in the output.\n",
