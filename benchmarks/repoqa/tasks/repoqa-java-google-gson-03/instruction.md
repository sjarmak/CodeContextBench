# RepoQA: Semantic Retrieval (SR-QA)

## Task: Find the Function

You are searching a large codebase for a specific function based on its behavior.

**Repository**: google/gson  
**Language**: java  
**Commit**: ee61e3f020351f0498dd3ff8f8386b96454a4dfe

## Function Description

```

1. **Purpose**: To retrieve the current element as a specific null type representation if it is indeed that type, ensuring type safety before casting.
2. **Input**: No parameters are required as it operates on the current instance of the element.
3. **Output**: Returns the element as a null type representation if it is valid; otherwise, it throws an exception.
4. **Procedure**: The method first checks if the current element is of the null type using a type-checking method. If the check passes, the element is cast to the null type and returned. If the check fails, an exception is thrown indicating that the element is not of the expected null type.

```

## Search Strategy

This function **cannot be found by searching for its name** because the name is not provided. You must:

1. **Understand the behavior** described above
2. **Use Sourcegraph MCP semantic search** to find functions matching this behavior
3. **Explore the code** using call graphs and references
4. **Narrow down** candidates until you find the exact function

### Sourcegraph MCP Tools You Should Use

- **`search_codebase`**: Semantic search for functions by behavior
- **`get_definition`**: Look up function definitions
- **`get_references`**: Find where functions are called
- **`get_call_graph`**: Understand function call relationships

## Output Format

You MUST provide your answer as valid JSON and **SAVE IT TO A FILE**:

```json
{
  "function_path": "path/to/file.py",
  "function_name": "the_function_name",
  "justification": "Why this function matches: describe the behavior you found"
}
```

**CRITICAL**: You MUST save the JSON to `/app/solution.json`. This location is required for Harbor verification.

**Your final step MUST be to run this exact bash command:**

```bash
cat > /app/solution.json << 'JSONEOF'
{
  "function_path": "ACTUAL_PATH",
  "function_name": "ACTUAL_NAME", 
  "justification": "ACTUAL_JUSTIFICATION_TEXT"
}
JSONEOF
```

Replace:
- `ACTUAL_PATH`: The file path you found (e.g., "requests/cookies.py" or "src/requests/cookies.py")
- `ACTUAL_NAME`: The function name (e.g., "extract_cookies_to_jar")
- `ACTUAL_JUSTIFICATION_TEXT`: Your explanation of why this is the right function

**You must run this bash command to complete the task.** Harbor will preserve files in `/app/` for the verification step.

## Notes

- The file path should be relative to repository root
- Function names are case-sensitive
- Provide your best match even if uncertain; explain your reasoning
- The justification is scored on how well it explains the function's behavior

## Scoring

- **Perfect** (1.0): Correct path AND name
- **Good** (0.7-0.9): Correct path, similar name OR vice versa
- **Partial** (0.3-0.6): Close approximation
- **Incorrect** (0.0): Wrong function entirely

Use Sourcegraph MCP liberally. That's the point of this task.
