## Bug Report

**Bug ID**: 203475
**Summary**: Samsung 860 EVO queued TRIM issues

I have a Samsung SSD 860 EVO mSATA 500GB SSD connected via an ASMedia ASM1062 Serial ATA Controller. It causes has 20-30 seconds lockups on fstrim (which runs during bootup on my system), with messages such as:

```
[  332.792044] ata14.00: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x3fffe SErr 0x0 action 0x6 frozen
[  332.798271] ata14.00: failed command: SEND FPDMA QUEUED
[  332.804499] ata14.00: cmd 64/01:08:00:00:00/00:00:00:00:00/a0 tag 1 ncq dma 512 out
                        res 40/00:00:00:00:00/00:00:00:00:00/00 Emask 0x4 (timeout)
[  332.817145] ata14.00: status: { DRDY }
```

After disabling queued TRIM via the included patch, the issue disappears.

## Task

You are a fault localization agent. Given the bug report above, your task is to identify the **exact source file(s)** and **function(s)/data structure(s)** in the Linux kernel source tree (at `/workspace`) that need to be modified to fix this bug.

You must:
1. Analyze the bug report to understand the symptoms and context
2. Search the kernel source code to identify the relevant subsystem and files
3. Narrow down to the specific file(s) and function(s)/data structure(s) that contain the bug or need modification
4. Write your findings to `/workspace/fault_localization_result.json` in the following format:

```json
{
  "buggy_files": ["path/to/file.c"],
  "buggy_functions": ["function_or_struct_name"],
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why these locations are the fault"
}
```

**Important**: Paths should be relative to the kernel source root (e.g., `drivers/ata/libata-core.c`, not `/workspace/drivers/...`).

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Correctly identify the buggy file(s)
- [ ] Correctly identify the buggy function(s) or data structure(s)
- [ ] Write results to `/workspace/fault_localization_result.json`
- [ ] Provide reasoning for the localization

## Testing

- **Time limit**: 1800 seconds
- Run `bash /workspace/tests/test.sh` to verify your findings
