# Fault Localization: ACPI Video Backlight Control Failure

## Bug Report

**Bug ID**: 207835
**Summary**: ACPI video backlight brightness control does not work on Acer TravelMate 5735Z by default

On the Intel GM45/GMA 4500MHD laptop with Debian Sid/unstable and Linux 5.6.7 and GNOME Shell 3.36.2, trying to change the brightness of the internal display using the function keys, GNOME shows the OSD, which seems to have five levels (from acer_wmi?), but the actual brightness does *not* change. There is only `/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness` though, and writing values to it seems to work.

Booting the system with `acpi_backlight=vendor`, exposes `/sys/devices/platform/acer-wmi/backlight/acer-wmi/brightness`, but the behavior is the same.

Booting the system with `acpi_backlight=native` or `acpi_backlight=native`, changing the brightness with the function keys works, and there now seem to be 15 (or 16) levels.

```

## Task

You are a fault localization agent. Given the bug report above, your task is to identify the **exact source file(s)** and **function(s)/data structure(s)** in the Linux kernel source tree (at `/workspace`) that need to be modified to fix this bug.

You must:
1. Analyze the bug report to understand the symptoms and context
2. Search the kernel source code to identify the relevant subsystem and files
3. Narrow down to the specific file(s) and function(s)/data structure(s) that contain the bug or need modification
4. Write your findings to `/workspace/fault_localization_result.json` in the following format:

```json
{
  "buggy_files": ["path/to/file.c"],
  "buggy_functions": ["function_or_struct_name"],
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why these locations are the fault"
}
```

**Important**: Paths should be relative to the kernel source root (e.g., `drivers/acpi/video_detect.c`, not `/workspace/drivers/acpi/video_detect.c`).

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Correctly identify the buggy file(s)
- [ ] Correctly identify the buggy function(s) or data structure(s)
- [ ] Write results to `/workspace/fault_localization_result.json`
- [ ] Provide reasoning for the localization

## Testing

- **Time limit**: 1800 seconds
- Run `bash /workspace/tests/test.sh` to verify your findings
