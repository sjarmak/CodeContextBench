# Fault Localization: HDA Intel Sound Fails After Suspend to RAM

- **Repository**: torvalds/linux
- **Kernel Version**: 3.7.6
- **Difficulty**: expert
- **Category**: fault_localization
- **Subsystem**: Drivers
- **Component**: Sound (HDA Intel)

## Bug Report

**Bug ID**: 53441
**Summary**: hda_intel: sound stops working after suspend to ram
**Regression**: Yes (works on v3.6.11, broken since v3.7.1)

On a fresh boot the sound card works fine. After a few suspends to ram (it doesn't necessarily happen after just one) the sound card stops working well. The sound comes out choppy, as a series of clicks separated by 2 second or so silences.

I see these messages in the kernel log right after resume:
```
hda-intel: azx_get_response timeout, switching to polling mode: last cmd=0x00170503
hda-intel: No response from codec, disabling MSI: last cmd=0x00170503
hda_intel: azx_get_response timeout, switching to single_cmd mode: last cmd=0x00170503
```

The only way to fix the sound seems to be a reboot. I don't have this problem with v3.6.11, it appeared with kernel v3.7.1 (I have not tested v3.7). Right now I'm running 3.7.6 and the problem is still there.

## Task

You are a fault localization agent. Given the bug report above, your task is to identify the **exact source file(s)** and **function(s)/data structure(s)** in the Linux kernel source tree (at `/workspace`) that need to be modified to fix this bug.

You must:
1. Analyze the bug report to understand the symptoms and context
2. Search the kernel source code to identify the relevant subsystem and files
3. Narrow down to the specific file(s) and function(s)/data structure(s) that contain the bug or need modification
4. Write your findings to `/workspace/fault_localization_result.json` in the following format:

```json
{
  "buggy_files": ["path/to/file.c"],
  "buggy_functions": ["function_or_struct_name"],
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why these locations are the fault"
}
```

**Important**: Paths should be relative to the kernel source root (e.g., `sound/pci/hda/hda_intel.c`, not `/workspace/sound/...`).

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Correctly identify the buggy file(s)
- [ ] Correctly identify the buggy function(s) or data structure(s)
- [ ] Write results to `/workspace/fault_localization_result.json`
- [ ] Provide reasoning for the localization

## Testing

- **Time limit**: 1800 seconds
- Run `bash /workspace/tests/test.sh` to verify your findings
