# Fault Localization: iwlwifi Missing PCI Subdevice Entries

- **Repository**: torvalds/linux
- **Kernel Version**: 5.6-rc2
- **Difficulty**: expert
- **Category**: fault_localization
- **Subsystem**: Drivers
- **Component**: network-wireless (Intel iwlwifi)

## Bug Report

**Bug ID**: 206661
**Summary**: iwlwifi:9260: missing PCI subdevice entries for 0x2526 (0x04010, 0x4018 and 0x401C)
**Regression**: Yes

I am using Kernel 5.6 RC2 and I am seeing issues where firmware is not being loaded for my Intel Corporation Wireless-AC 9260 card. Attached is the boot logging.

If I can do anything to debug, let me know.

## Task

You are a fault localization agent. Given the bug report above, your task is to identify the **exact source file(s)** and **function(s)/data structure(s)** in the Linux kernel source tree (at `/workspace`) that need to be modified to fix this bug.

You must:
1. Analyze the bug report to understand the symptoms and context
2. Search the kernel source code to identify the relevant subsystem and files
3. Narrow down to the specific file(s) and function(s)/data structure(s) that contain the bug or need modification
4. Write your findings to `/workspace/fault_localization_result.json` in the following format:

```json
{
  "buggy_files": ["path/to/file.c"],
  "buggy_functions": ["function_or_struct_name"],
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why these locations are the fault"
}
```

**Important**: Paths should be relative to the kernel source root (e.g., `drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/pcie/drv.c`, not `/workspace/drivers/...`).

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Correctly identify the buggy file(s)
- [ ] Correctly identify the buggy function(s) or data structure(s)
- [ ] Write results to `/workspace/fault_localization_result.json`
- [ ] Provide reasoning for the localization

## Testing

- **Time limit**: 1800 seconds
- Run `bash /workspace/tests/test.sh` to verify your findings
