## Codebase Patterns
- codereview tasks clone target repos (Ghost, aspnetcore, cal.com) and inject defects via Dockerfile patches
- Hybrid scoring: 0.5 * detection_F1 + 0.5 * fix_score, output to /logs/verifier/reward.txt
- Agent dual output: code fixes committed to workspace + /workspace/review.json structured review
- Ground truth in tests/expected_defects.json and tests/expected_patches/
- DIR_PREFIX_TO_SUITE mapping needed in both generate_manifest.py and aggregate_status.py
