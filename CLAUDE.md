# CodeScaleBench Agent Router

This file is the root entrypoint for AI agents working in this repository.
Keep it small. Use it to route to the right workflow and local guide, not as the
full operations manual.

## Non-Negotiables
- All work happens on `main` by default. If you use feature branches, keep them small, short-lived, and easy to fast-forward back into `main`.
- Every `harbor run` must be gated by interactive confirmation.
- Before commit/push, run `python3 scripts/repo_health.py` (or `--quick` for docs/config-only changes).
- Prefer a **remote execution environment** (e.g., Daytona) for large benchmark runs; use local Docker only when a task’s image or registry is incompatible with your cloud environment. See `docs/DAYTONA.md`.
- Set **parallelism based on your own account and model limits**. Avoid exceeding documented concurrency or rate caps for your environment or provider.

## Beads Prerequisite
- Keep the Beads CLI (`bd`, alias `beads`) up to date before running agent workflows that rely on task graphs.
- Install or update with the official installer:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steveyegge/beads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```
- Verify install/version with `bd --version` (or `beads --version`).

## Minimal Loading Policy
- Default load order: this file + one relevant skill + one relevant doc.
- Do not open broad catalogs (`docs/TASK_CATALOG.md`, large script lists, full reports) unless required.
- Prefer directory-local `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` when working under `scripts/`, `configs/`, `tasks/`, or `docs/`.

## Fast Routing By Intent
- Launch or rerun benchmarks: `docs/DAYTONA.md` (Daytona, preferred) or `docs/START_HERE_BY_TASK.md`
- Monitor / status: `docs/START_HERE_BY_TASK.md` -> "Monitor Active Runs"
- Triage failures: `docs/START_HERE_BY_TASK.md` -> "Triage Failed Tasks"
- Compare configs / MCP impact / IR: `docs/START_HERE_BY_TASK.md` -> "Analyze Results"
- Repo policy / health gate: `docs/REPO_HEALTH.md`, `docs/ops/WORKFLOWS.md`
- Script discovery: `docs/ops/SCRIPT_INDEX.md`

## Local Guides
- `scripts/AGENTS.md` - script categories, safe usage, one-off handling
- `configs/AGENTS.md` - run launcher wrappers and confirmation gate policy
- `docs/AGENTS.md` - documentation IA and canonical vs archive guidance

## Compaction / Handoff Checkpoints
- Compact after exploration, before multi-file edits.
- Compact after launching a benchmark batch.
- Compact after completing a triage batch or report generation pass.
- Use `docs/ops/HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md` when handing work to a new session.

## Canonical Maps
- `docs/START_HERE_BY_TASK.md` - task-based read order
- `docs/ops/WORKFLOWS.md` - operational workflow summaries
- `docs/ops/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - escalation and common failure routing
- `docs/ops/SCRIPT_INDEX.md` - generated script registry index
- `docs/reference/README.md` - stable specs and reference docs
- `docs/explanations/README.md` - rationale and context docs

## Maintenance
- Root and local `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` files are generated from sources in `docs/ops/`.
- `docs/START_HERE_BY_TASK.md` is generated from `docs/ops/task_routes.json`.
- Regenerate after edits (single command):
```bash
python3 scripts/refresh_agent_navigation.py
```
